# LeetCode 30 Days Challenge

```markdown 
## Overview

Welcome to the LeetCode 30 Days Challenge in C++! This repository is created to help you enhance your problem-solving skills in C++ by solving one LeetCode problem every day for the next 30 days.

## How it Works

- Each day, a new LeetCode problem will be assigned.
- Your goal is to solve the assigned problem and submit your solution by creating a new C++ file in the designated directory.
- Feel free to collaborate, discuss, and learn from others by participating in discussions.

## Directory Structure

- Day 1:
  - `problem_name_1.cpp` (Your C++ solution for Day 1)
- Day 2:
  - `problem_name_2.cpp` (Your C++ solution for Day 2)
- ...
- Day 30:
  - `problem_name_30.cpp` (Your C++ solution for Day 30)

## Guidelines

1. File Naming:
    - Name your C++ files following the format `problem_name_day.cpp`. For example, `two_sum_1.cpp` for Day 1's Two Sum problem.

2. Code Comments:
    - Include comments to explain your thought process and approach in the C++ code.

3. Discussion:
    - Engage in discussions with others. Share your approach and learn from different perspectives.

4. Efficiency:
    - Aim for efficient solutions. Discuss and optimize your C++ code where possible.

5. Contribute:
    - Feel free to contribute additional test cases, explanations, or alternative C++ solutions.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a branch for the current day (`day-1`, `day-2`, etc.).
4. Solve the assigned LeetCode problem in C++.
5. Commit your C++ solution to your branch.
6. Push the changes to your forked repository.
7. Create a pull request when you are ready to submit your C++ solution.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LeetCode30DaysChallenge.git

# Change directory to the project folder
cd LeetCode30DaysChallenge

# Create a new branch for Day 1
git checkout -b day-1

# Solve the assigned problem and save your C++ solution to `day-1` directory

# Add and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add C++ solution for Day 1"

# Push the changes to your forked repository
git push origin day-1

# Create a pull request on GitHub
```
